We offer a short but sweet range of breakfast options, each can be served with a side of pancakes:

For those lazy mornings where everything feels slow and cold, this meal is designed for brightening your day up.
Butterflied saussage with a sprinkeling of cheddar, served inside a lightly toasted plain flour tortilla.

This simple classic never fails to wow, with a runny yolk poached egg sat perfectly atop golden brown-lightly buttered toast.
This breakfast option pairs great with a glass of cool orange juice.

We serve this with an optional side of smoked salmon, at the diners request.
