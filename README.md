# Welcome to El's
We are famous for the friendliest breakfast - in bed or in our kitchenside lounge.
Every meal is prepared with the most love you can imagine and no corners are cut.
We have a wide variety of breakfast dishes to choose from; each designed to be enjoyed with a hot capuccino or fresh juice from the bottle, so why not check out our menu below!

## Breakfast
We offer a short but sweet range of breakfast options, each can be served with a side of pancakes:

### Chef's special: Saussage wrap
For those lazy mornings where everything feels slow and cold, this meal is designed for brightening your day up.
Butterflied saussage with a sprinkeling of cheddar, served inside a lightly toasted plain flour tortilla.

### Poached egg on toast
This simple classic never fails to wow, with a runny yolk poached egg sat perfectly atop golden brown-lightly buttered toast.
This breakfast option pairs great with a glass of cool orange juice.

### Eggs royale
A beautiful classic option; toasted muffin serves as the base for two perfect runny poached eggs, glazed in our traditional house hollandaise sauce made from scratch, with love.
We serve this with an optional side of smoked salmon, at the diners request.

### Pancakes
A three or five stack of either thin-engilsh or fluffy-american pancakes, with virtually any topping you like.
Just speak to the chef and he will tey his best to accomodate.

### Full english
Saussage, egg, bacon, beans and toast - the cornerstones of a perfect morning.
This breakfast is guaranteed to leave you full and warm inside.
